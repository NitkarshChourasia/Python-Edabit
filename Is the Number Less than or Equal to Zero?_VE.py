# Submitted Solution.
# Main program starts here.

def lessThanOrEqualZero(input1):
    print(True) if input1 <= 0 else print(False)

# Main program ends here.
# My code after this.

lessThanOrEqualZero(5)
lessThanOrEqualZero(0)
lessThanOrEqualZero(-2)

# My code ends here.
# Program runs as expected.
# Congratulations on that, Nitkarsh Chourasia.
# Well done.
