Will experiment with *Assignment Operators*.
like
    sum = sum + i   c += i
    sum = sum - i   c -= i    
    sum = sum * i   c *= i 
    sum = sum / i   c /= i
    sum = sum % i   c %= i
    sum = sum ** i  c **= i
    sum = sum // i  c //= i

So I will try to experiment with all this in actual programs.
Which I will be able to apply in edabit...
No worries about it...

Another program I can make myself is of this...
perimeter of square -- using functions
area of the square -- using functions...
can make two kinds in it ... like --l
if only one input then print area if two then print area...--I think the concept is wrong...
I will start making multi functions programs slow by slow
let's see what happens...
this formula things I can incorporate really...
# Good stuff...
