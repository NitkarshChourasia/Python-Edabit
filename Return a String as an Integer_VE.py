####### Main program starts here. #######
def string_int(txt):
    return int(txt)
####### Main program ends here. ######
# Program lines after this were not submitted to the edabit.
# It is for the user to print the outputs, for myself I mean.
a = string_int('42342')
print(type(a))
print(string_int('5454'))
print(type(string_int('23542')))
# So, it for sure converts string into integer, respectfully so.
