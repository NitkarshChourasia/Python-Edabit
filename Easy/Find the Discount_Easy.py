Create a function that takes two arguments:
the original price and the discount percentage as integers and returns the final price after the discount.
Examples:
    dis(1500, 50) âžž 750
# Notes:
    Your answer should be rounded to two decimal places.

    # return (round(main,2)) # This one shows not all the zeroes all the time, but when needed then it shows.
